Need to consistently use the standard library functions for doing c-string things (strcpy, strcmp). If you do your own, then you  
waste people's time that are looking at your code because they think you must be doing something that one of the provided functions  
don't do. Plus, more buggy and error-prone. ALWAYS use a lib function when one is available.

Default constructor shouldn't allocate one byte of memory - allocating memory is "expensive" (takes the machine more work), so even  
allocating one byte unnecessarily isn't efficient
